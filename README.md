# Tic Tac Toe 🎮

A web-based implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game using **JavaScript**, following the **Factory Function** and **Module Pattern** architecture. Part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## 🔍 Description

Two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players alternate turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins. If all cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

## 🧠 Goals & Concepts

- Practice **Factory Functions** to create player objects.
- Use the **Module Pattern (IIFE)** for encapsulation and state management.
- Deepen understanding of:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Game logic implementation
  - Separation of concerns
  - Clean code architecture in vanilla JavaScript
